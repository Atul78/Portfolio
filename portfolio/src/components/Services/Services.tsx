            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>
              As a web developer, I create dynamic and functional websites using
              a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. I specialize
              in building responsive, user-friendly interfaces that enhance the
              user experience. Whether itâ€™s an e-commerce site, a blog, or a
              custom web application, I bring ideas to life through code.

            <h3>UI Development</h3>
            <p>
              As a UI developer, I specialize in creating visually appealing and
              user-friendly interfaces for web applications. I work closely with
              designers and product managers to translate design concepts into
              functional and engaging user interfaces.

            <h3>UI Designing</h3>
            <p>
              UI design is all about aesthetics and usability. As a UI designer,
              I craft visually appealing layouts, choose color schemes, and
              create intuitive navigation.
